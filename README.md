# ðŸ’« About this app:
This is a fun project I did before I started my CS degree. The intent is to give you a rhythm guitar practice routine. It's easy to fall in to the a rut and play the same chord progressions and strumming patterns every practice session. <br><br>This app helps prevent you from practicing the same stale rhythms over and over. It generates a chord progression in a random key, gives you a random strumming pattern, and a random BPM.
